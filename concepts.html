    <h1>what is SQL?</h1>
    <h4>is a language usedfor ralational databases to query or get data out of a database. it is also reffered to as 'sequel' short for "Structured Query language"</h4> <br>
    <br>
    <h1>what is data? and what is database?</h1>
    <h4>data is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers or even pictures. <br> data is one of the most critical assests of any business. <br> <br> Data is important. So it needs to be secure, and it nedds to be stored and accessed quickly</h4>

    <h1>What is a database?</h1>
    <h4>A database is a repository of data. It is a program that stores data. It also provides thr functionality for adding, modifying, and querying that data.</h4>

    <h1>Different kind of databases for different requirements</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>relational database {Stored in a tabular form}, this is columns and rows.</li>    
    </ul>

    <h2>A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a database management system{DBMS}</h2> <br>
    <h3>Database can also be reffered to as; <br>
    <li>database server</li>
    <li>Database system</li>
    <li>Data server</li>
    <li>Database management system</li>

    <h1>RDBMS(relational database management system)</h1>
    <h4>Is a set of software tools that controls the data, such as access, organization and storage</h4>

    <h1>Five simple commands to use:</h1>
    <li>Create a table</li>
    <li>insert data to  populate the table</li>

Hello, and welcome to Information models and Data models. In this video, we will
learn about different types of models. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to
describe the difference between an information model and a data model, explain the advantage
of the relational model, and describe the difference between an entity and an attribute.
This figure illustrates the relationship between an Information Model and a Data Model.
An Information Model is an abstract, formal representation of entities that includes their
properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entities
being modeled can be from the real world, such as a library. Information Models
and Data Models are different and serve different purposes. An Information Model is at the conceptual
level, and defines relationships between objects. Data Models are defined at a more
concrete level, are specific and include details. A data model is the blueprint of any database
system. There are several types of Information Models. The most popular is the Hierarchical,
typically used to show organization charts. As shown is in this figure, the hierarchical
model organizes its data using a tree structure. The root of the tree is the parent node followed
by child nodes. A child node cannot have more than one parent, however, a parent can have
many child nodes. The first hierarchical database management system was the Information Management
System released by IBM in 1968 and was originally built as the database for the Apollo space
program. The Relational Model is the most used data model for databases because
this model allows for data independence. Data is stored in a simple data structure, tables.
This provides logical data independence, physical data independence, and physical storage independence.
An Entity-Relationship Data Model, or ER Data Model, is an alternative to a relational
data model. Using a simplified library database as an example, this figure shows an Entity-Relationship
Diagram, or ERD, that represents entities (called tables) and their relationships.
We have authors who write books, borrowers who take books out on loan, various copies
of each book, etc. This is the final ER diagram. But how do we get there? An Entity-Relationship
Model proposes thinking of a database as a collection of entities. Rather than being
used as a model on its own, the ER Model is used as a tool to design relational databases.
In the ER Model, entities are objects that exist independently of any other entities
in the database. It is simple to convert an ER Diagram into a collection of tables.
The building blocks of an ER Diagram are entities and attributes. Entities have attributes,
which are the data elements that characterize the entity. Attributes tell us more about
the entity. In an ER Diagram, an entity is drawn as a rectangle, and attributes are drawn
as ovals. Entities can be a noun (person, place, or thing). Using a simplified library
as an example, a book is an example of an entity. Attributes are certain properties
or characteristics of an entity, and tell us more about the entity. The entity Book
has attributes such as book title, the edition of the book, the year the book was written,
etc. Attributes are connected to exactly one entity. The entity Book becomes a table
in the database, and the attributes become the columns in a table. Continuing the
simplified library example, books are written by authors. Book is an entity, and Author
is an entity . For the entity Author, the ER Diagram would look like this. The entity
Author has attributes such as the author's last name, first name, email, city, country
and an author ID (to uniquely identify the author). The entity Author becomes a table
in the database, and the attributes become the columns in the table. In the simplified
library database, we progress through the process of identifying entities, such as borrowers
who take books out on loan, various copies of each book, and copies of books out on loan.
This is the final ER Diagram. Each entity becomes a table in the database. You
can now describe the difference between an information model and a data model, explain
the advantage of the relational </p>
